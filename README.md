Extra resources and documentation for the manuscript "Performance Evaluation of a Textile Manufacturing Using Stochastic Petri Nets" submitted to the IEEE Latin America Transactions. The files are organized as follows:

- Model generated in the SPNP modeling tool;
- Results compiled in the RStudio IDE with the R-Markdown package;

Early stages

1- The installation of SPNP can be seen at the link below, where the specificities of this tool, which is still little explored in academia, are presented;

3- Application of the stochastic analysis of the model that represents the case study of the productive process of textile manufacturing.

4- compilation of results obtained in RStudio for evaluation and validation.

Requirements

- Computer with Microsoft Windows 10 Professional 64-bit operating system, Core I7 2.90 GHz processor generation 7, 250 GB SSD HDD and 16 GB RAM memory.

- Installation of SPNP 0.2.

- installation RStudio 4.2.2.
