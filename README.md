![Performance Evaluation of a Textile Manufacturing (5)](https://github.com/dmax2023/Performance_Evaluation_Textile_Manufacturing/assets/128255987/a5545c80-7863-4d1f-ae32-13044c11901d)

Extra resources and documentation for the manuscript "Performance Evaluation of a Textile Manufacturing Using Stochastic Petri Nets". The files are organized as follows:

- Model generated in the SPNP modeling tool;
- Results compiled in the RStudio IDE with the R-Markdown package;

Early stages

1- The installation of SPNP can be seen at the link below, where the specificities of this tool, which is still little explored in academia, are presented;

3- Application of the stochastic analysis of the model that represents the case study of the productive process of textile manufacturing.

4- compilation of results obtained in RStudio for evaluation and validation.
